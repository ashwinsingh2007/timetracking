Some Notes:
1) Using openly available tutorials is great. We're a startup, so no
points are awarded for working hard, only getting the job done quickly
and correctly.

2) If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Points are not deducted
for questions. Part of the exercise is to see how we communicate and if
we can be efficient.

3) Make sure you test your work, and if you have them, provide the tests
to us. It's important to know there is attention to detail in your work.
